Final Project for CS 655: The NewNew Times

# The NewNew Times :newspaper::apple::statue_of_liberty:
A `NodeJS`, `MongoDB`, `Express`, and `ReactJS` application where users can query, display, and save articles from the [New York Times Article Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/). Users can remove saved articles as well.

**Live Demo**: https://zooyorktimes-scraper.herokuapp.com/ (NEEDS TO BE UPDATED!)

## Functionality
On the backend, the app uses `express` to serve routes and `mongoose` to interact with a `MongoDB` database.

On the frontend, the app uses `ReactJS` for rendering components, `axios` for internal/external API calls, and `bootstrap` as a styling framework.

In order to transpile the JSX code, `webpack` and `babel` were utilized. All of the JSX  code in the `/app` folder was transpiled into the `bundle.js` file located in the `/public` folder.

## New York Times API
Prior to starting this app and getting an `unnecessary` error message, you'll probably want to swap out the API Key provided in the `client/src/utils/API.js` file.
